# Voting Server

Server element of a voting application that sets the entries, tallies the votes, brings the application to the next state, and can restart the application to its original state. Server is run locally at the moment. But, one can deploy this by changing server.js. Currently, the entries are the candidates for the 2016-2017 NBA MVP award. This can be changed by altering entries.json. Client element can be found [here](https://github.com/TheSivaMuthusamy/voting-client)
